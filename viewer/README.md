This directory contains the HTML5 viewer app for SpeakEasy.

This HTML5 app is entirely client side.  You may run it directly from the file system with the `file://` protocol.

In addition to the files provided here, you must also include the `scavenger.js` library from the [Scavenger project](https://github.com/canidlogic/scavenger).
